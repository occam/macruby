HotConsole is an graphical IRB-like console written using HotCocoa.
It does not use the IRB code at all
Its advantages compared to the command line macirb:
- you can easily enter non-ASCII characters
- multiple windows, with code running in multiple threads

A few shortcuts:
- Alt+Up/Down to navigate in the history
- Alt+Enter to type text on multiple lines
